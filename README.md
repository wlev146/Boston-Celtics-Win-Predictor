# Boston Celtics Game Outcome Predictor  

Built a machine learning model to predict Boston Celtics game outcomes using team performance metrics and engineered game-context variables. The objective was to identify the strongest drivers of wins and test whether contextual features improved predictive accuracy.  

## What I Did  

- Collected and cleaned team, player, and opponent data  
- Engineered features including opponent win percentage, rest days, home/away splits, and prior game momentum  
- Built regression and classification models in Python (Scikit-learn)  
- Visualized trends in Tableau to translate findings into clear insights  

## Key Insights  

- Defensive rebounding and three-point efficiency were the strongest consistent indicators of wins  
- Bench scoring and opponent strength significantly impacted outcomes  
- Contextual features (rest, momentum, competition level) improved predictive performance  

## Tools Used  

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn), Excel, Tableau
