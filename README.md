## Overview  
This project was one of the first times I had full creative control over a machine learning project, and I wanted to connect what I was learning to something that genuinely interests me. As a lifelong basketball fan, I have always been curious about how data can reveal the patterns behind a team’s success or failure. I chose the Boston Celtics because they represent a well-structured and competitive team, and I wanted to see how their performance metrics aligned with their results. The main goal was to uncover the factors that most influence wins and to explore whether certain engineered statistics could give a predictive edge.  

What started as a class project quickly became an experiment in creativity and problem solving. Instead of just analyzing the usual box score numbers, I wanted to create my own data points and find new ways to interpret the game.

## Goals  
- Analyze Celtics team and player data to identify performance drivers  
- Engineer new variables to capture game context and competition strength  
- Build and test machine learning models to predict outcomes  
- Visualize trends that connect player efficiency and overall success

## Tools and Skills Used  
- **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit learn  
- **Excel:** data cleaning and feature creation  
- **Tableau:** dashboards and data storytelling  
- **Techniques:** regression modeling, feature engineering, and data wrangling

## Process  
I began by collecting and cleaning data that included team performance, player statistics, and opponent information. The biggest challenge early on was ensuring consistency between datasets. Once the data was structured, I engineered new variables to add more context.  

For example, I calculated **opponent win percentage up to each matchup** to measure how strong a team’s competition was at that point in the season. I also factored in **rest days**, **home versus away splits**, and **previous game outcomes** to see how momentum or fatigue might play a role.  

After creating those new features, I ran basic regression and classification models to test what truly affected the Celtics chances of winning. I then visualized the relationships in Tableau to make the results easier to understand and present.

## Key Findings  
- The Celtics win rate increased sharply when bench scoring exceeded thirty points  
- Defensive rebounding and three point accuracy were the strongest consistent indicators of success  
- Opponent win percentage and recent momentum were highly predictive when combined with efficiency metrics  
- Lineup consistency and team chemistry often mattered more than individual player stats

## Challenges and Lessons Learned  
This was the first project where I truly built data rather than just analyzing what already existed. Creating new features like opponent strength and rest metrics taught me how to think critically about context. Cleaning and testing those ideas required patience, but it showed me that creativity is just as important in analytics as technical skill. I also learned how to communicate findings clearly so that anyone could understand what the data was actually showing.

## Reflection  
This project reminded me why I enjoy working with data. It combined curiosity, creativity, and competition in a way that felt natural. Using basketball as my focus gave me the freedom to experiment, make mistakes, and learn what it means to build something from scratch. More than anything, it showed me that analytics can bring the game to life from a different angle. It is not just about numbers but about how those numbers connect to performance, decisions, and storytelling.
